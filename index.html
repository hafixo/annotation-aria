# Introduction

## Definitions

The following terminology is informed by the Web Annotation Data Model [[annotation-model]]
specification.

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>annotation</dfn></dt>
  <dd>An annotation is the combination of <a>annotated content</a> and its related <a>annotation body</a>.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>annotated content</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The annotated content is the range of text or other object which the <a>annotation body</a> is "about".
  <!-- TODO: make this more respec-y -->
  <blockquote>Note: In the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#motivation-and-purpose">Web Annotations Data Model</a>,
    this is known as the <strong>annotation target</strong>. However, because
    the term "target" has a specific meaning in accessibility APIs as the end
    (and not beginning) of a relation, the term annotated content is preferred
    here, in order to avoid confusion with the actual directionality of
    <code>aria-details</code> in ARIA annotation markup.</blockquote></dd>

  <dt><dfn>annotation body</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The annotation body is visible information within a page which is connected to <a>annotated content</a> for a related purpose.</dd>

  <dt><dfn>annotation purpose</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The annotation purpose is the role the <a>annotation body</a> plays in relation to the <a>annotated content</a> (e.g. commentary vs. a footnote).</dd>

</dl>

## How do ARIA annotations relate to the Web Annotations Data Model?

ARIA annotations are more limited than what can be expressed in the Web Annotations Data Model [[annotation-model]].
* They cannot point to information external to the web page
* They must point to additional information within that web page (e.g. a simple "highlight" does not do this).

In addition, ARIA annotations do not contain as much information. It only contains what is necessary for the identified use cases.

For more information, please see the [](#annotation-model-mappings).

<section id="use-cases">
# Use Cases

## Web Content

*   Document editor
*   Code editor
*   Published content

## Assistive Technology

* AT user issues command to navigate to previous/next <a>annotated content</a> (e.g. next commented text)
* AT user issues command to navigate to previous/next <a>annotation body</a> (e.g. next comment)
* AT user issues one of the above commands, but filtered by <a>annotation purpose</a> (e.g. commentary only)
* AT user issues command to navigate from <a>annotation body</a> to the <a>annotated content</a>, or vice-versa
* Screen reader provides viewing options for reading <a>annotation purposes</a>, where the purpose is shortened, e.g. "commentary" becomes "*ct"

<section id="markup">
# Proposed Markup


## **aria-details** (required, IDREF)

*   Goes on the <a>annotated content</a>, and points to the in-page <a>annotation body</a>.
*   No specific tag or `role` is required. However, it may be desirable to prefer `&lt;mark&gt;` over a generic element such as `&lt;span&gt;` when there is a visible highlight

<pre class="example highlight">
&lt;mark aria-details="comments"&gt;This is commented text&lt;/mark&gt;
</pre>

## **role** (optional, NMTOKENS) on the <a>annotation body</a>

*   Goes on the <a>annotation body</a>, describing the <a>annotation purpose</a>. See below for a [list of roles](#roles) and more details.

<pre class="example highlight">
&lt;div role="annotation-commentary"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

As is always the case, multiple `role` values are supported: if more than one `role` value is provided then the first recognized `role` may be mapped through accessibility APIs. The most important or specific role should always go first.

For example the following would indicate that there is a suggestion with comments, but some APIs may only expose it as a "suggestion":

<pre class="example highlight">
&lt;div role="annotation-suggestion annotation-commentary group"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

## **`&lt;ins&gt;`**/**`&lt;del&gt;`** (required for the "revision" and "suggestion" <a>annotation purposes</a>)

*   Provided as children of the <a>annotated content</a>, and define a past change or proposed future change to the document.

<div class="issue">[TBD] @aleventhal: Alternatively, if/when ARIA provides roles for insertion and deletion, the `role` attribute could be used instead.</div>

<pre class="example highlight">
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is encouraged to bring a &lt;span aria-details="suggestion-info-1"&gt;&lt;del&gt;side dish&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;beverage&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to share.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

*   Ordering: the ARIA spec should define whether the order is important for these 1-2 children. I suggest the AT should handle all permutations in the ordering.

## **aria-label**/**aria-labelledby/aria-describedby** (optional)

<div class="issue">@bigbluehat Take this out? move to appendix? mark "at risk"?</div>

In addition, this markup may be helpful, but is not really part of the annotations spec:

*   If this is found on the <a>annotation body</a>, it could provides a useful label or description for the <a>annotation</a>, that could be presented by a screen reader in a mode where the user wanted to understand more about the <a>annotation bodies</a> in context but the <a>annotation bodies</a> themselves would be too long.
</section>

<section id="roles">
# Roles for <a>annotation purposes</a>

These go on the <a>annotation body</a>, not the <a>annotated content</a>.

All <code>annotation-</code> prefixed `role` values would inherit from an abstract role of `annotation`, which would inherit from `structure`. If the `role` attribute is not provided, then the <a>annotation</a> is simply treated as a description, as it would already be via `aria-details` usage.

*   **annotation-attribution** — authoring information for the <a>annotated content</a>.
<div class="issue">[TBD] @mck we may want to choose a better name as this name may ultimately just be used by screen readers and most users might not know what to make of it.</div>
<div class="issue">[TBD#2] @aleventhal: recommend we make this redundant with `annotation-revision`, and remove this one.</div>

*   **annotation-commentary** — one or more comments, or a comment thread
*   **annotation-description**  — generic description. This is also the default if the annotation purpose is unspecified.
<div class="issue">[TBD] @aleventhal: rather than add an extra role here, how about the author simply not use any of the other annotation roles.</div>

*   **annotation-revision** — this is a historical change that has already been accepted. The source <a>annotated content</a> will contain 1-2 children for the insertion and/or deletion.
*   **annotation-suggestion** — proposed edit. The source <a>annotated content</a> will contain 1-2 children for the proposed insertion and/or deletion.

*   **annotation-presence** — similar to attribution, but relates to editing that is happening right now. For example, "Mr. Smith is editing nearby".
*   **doc-footnote**/**doc-endnote** for footnotes and endnotes. When using DPUB roles, the <a>annotated content</a> will be the referencing note number. The author may choose to leave out the `doc-noteref` role on the <a>annotated content</a>, as that will be exposed as a link to ATs (see [[DPUB-AAM-1.0]]), and it may not be a link. In addition, the fact that it is a note reference number is implied by the relation with the <a>annotation body</a>, which will have the `doc-footnote` or `doc-endnote` role.

Use the singular form: for consistency, all of the <a>annotation purposes</a> are in the singular form of the word, even though in some cases the plural could have made sense, as in "suggestion" where there may be multiple suggestions.

<section id="rejects">
# Rejected annotation purposes

<div class="issue">@bigbluehat: move this to an appendix? remove it? Kind of nice to know what we didn't do and why</div>

For now, the following annotation purposes have not been assigned new roles:

* **highlight**  — this does not fit the proposed definition of an <a>annotation</a> in that it does not point to additional info. Therefore, ARIA WG should consider adding something like `role=mark` (would need to be added for role parity), or the author can use HTML via `&lt;mark&gt;`/`&lt;em&gt;`/`&lt;strong&gt;`
* **error** — in code in code editor: use the already supported `aria-invalid="true"` + `aria-errormessage=id`
* **warning** — in code editor: may want to add `aria-invalid="warning"` as possible value (and like error, can use `aria-errormessage=id`)
* **bookmark** — similar to `annotation-presence`; would need more info on this use case in order to support it.
<div class="issue">[TBD] @aleventhal: Suggest that the author can use `&lt;mark aria-label="Bookmark name"&gt;` for a good experience.</div>
* **breakpoint**— does not always come with additional visible information, so it would be difficult to shoehorn into this use case.
<div class="issue">[TBD] @aleventhal: For this one, perhaps a `&lt;mark&gt;` or `role="mark"` or a new `role="breakpoint"` could be used, along with `aria-label`. Or, a visible button could be used on the line with the breakpoint, that is labelled as a breakpoint button.</div>

# Platform Accessibility mappings

*   [UI Automation has built-in support for annotations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winauto/uiauto-annotation-type-identifiers) — note that a perfect 1 to 1 mapping is not expected here. For example, a grammar error is an annotation in UIA, but in ARIA is `aria-invalid="grammar"`. An important difference with UIA annotations is that ARIA annotations always link to visible in-page content.
*   Most of the markup is reused — there are already known ways for exposing `aria-details`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, `&lt;ins&gt;` and `&lt;del>`.
*   For aria-annotation, this should be exposed as an object attribute called "annotation" in ATK/IA2
<div class="issue">@bigbluehat: does "aria-annotation" here mean this spec? It seems to (vs. an attribute or value)</div>

<section id="annotation-model-mappings">
## Addendum: Mapping from the Web Annotation Data Model

An important use case is to convert annotation data from the Web Annotation Data Model [[annotation-model]] (typically in JSON format) into accessible content, with the goal of enabling AT support. The following are non-normative suggestions for accomplishing this.

<aside class="example" title="Describing a relationship to in-page visible content">

Translating a "commenting" motivation in the Web Annotation Data Model to the appropriate ARIA and HTML markup:

<pre class="highlight">
  &lt;p&gt;The following cats have been deemed &lt;span aria-details="comment-thread-1"&gt;uncooperative&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div id="comment-thread-1" role="annotation-commentary"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Comment by Ruff Finkledog&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be simpler to list the cooperative cats?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
</aside>

<aside class="example" title="Describing a Web Annotation that does not have a relationship to other content">

This example is useful for the "highlighting" motivation.

<pre class="highlight">
&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;mark&gt;cat&lt;/mark&gt; is highlighted&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</aside>

<aside class="example" title="Describing a Web Annotation that is related to external content only">

This example is useful for the "identifying" motivation.

<pre class="highlight">
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; is one of our favorite quirky pets.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
</aside>
